# FractionCalculator
A fraction calculator made with Qt Creator and C++

The code used to create the Fraction class was then converted to a Dynamic Linked Library, and placed in the solutions folder with the .exe for the calculator (FractionGUI_14mk64.exe) and all other necessary .dll files for the GUI elements. If all the files in the solution folder are downloaded and placed in the same directory and the exe is ran, the calculator should be fully functional.

The FractionDLL folder holds code that converts the fraction class to a dll.

Fraction Class holds the actual C++ code for the fraction class.
